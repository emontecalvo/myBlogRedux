MY BLOG REDUX:

A basic full-stack CRUD-operation app, done in React with Redux.

MERN stack:  Mongodb, Express, React, Node.js.



Basic full-stack JavaScript app template

To install: npm install

To build: npm run build

To start the server: npm run start

To start in dev mode, with everything watched: npm run watch

TODO: Use makefiles to cut down on some of the work (eg 'npm run start'
currently runs 'npm run build' unconditionally).
